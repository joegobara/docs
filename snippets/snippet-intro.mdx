When building documentation, we follow the same DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle 
that guides good software development. Instead of copying and pasting the same content 
across multiple pages, use snippets to maintain consistency and make updates easier. 
Snippets are reusable content blocks that help you keep your documentation synchronized 
and professional.
